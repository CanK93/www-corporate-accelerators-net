title: The Corporate Accelerator Database

Corporate Accelerators are still a relatively new, but [quickly growing](http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/25/corporate-accelerators-are-an-oxymoron/) phenomena. Data about them is rare, though, which is why we launched this [database](/database/index.html).

**June 2015**: We are still at the earliest stages of this project, so please be aware of the following limitations:

* We do not yet list jointly sponsored programs (but it's on the road-map!)
* We don't yet show statistics, but that's on its way as well
