# The Corporate Accelerator Database

https://www.corporate-accelerators.net

Corporate Accelerators are still a relatively new, but [quickly growing](http://techcrunch.com/2014/08/25/corporate-accelerators-are-an-oxymoron/) phenomena. Data about them is rare, though, which is why we launched this [database](https://www.corporate-accelerators.net/database/index.html).

You've found some data that is out of date or you are aware of a new program? Great! We do our very best to keep this database as up-to-date as possible. As you might have seen each entry in the list has a timestamp when we last updated the data in case you were wondering.

If you're comfortable with GitHub you can modify the data on your own by editing the [JSON source](https://github.com/florianheinemann/www-corporate-accelerators-net/blob/master/_data/Accelerators.json).

Otherwise, please open an issue here on GitHub, send us a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thesumofall), or via [email](mailto:hello@florianheinemann.com).

**June 2015**: We are still at the earliest stages of this project, so please be aware of the following limitations:

* We do not yet list jointly sponsored programs (but it's on the road-map!)
* We don't yet show statistics, but that's on its way as well
