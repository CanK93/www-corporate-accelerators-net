I just published my full Master's thesis about Corporate Accelerators and their recent growth on my [personal website](https://www.florianheinemann.com/innovation/2015/08/10/Corporate-Accelerators.html). It covers the recent macro-level trends and dives into the types of companies that are sponsoring such programs. In addition, I address the strategic aims of the sponsoring firms.
